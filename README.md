1. PROBLEM STATEMENT 

The Educational Satellite Attitude Lab is a project to improve satellite operations education at Florida Tech by constructing a laboratory similar to commercial ground stations. ESATs and EyaSATS are currently being used, but there are only two of each and students need to take turns during lab sessions. These satellites cost over $6,000 and $12,000 respectively, not including hardware used to set up experiments. There is a need for lower-cost educational satellite models that could be assembled in a university setting from commodity hardware.  


2. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES 

OBJ-01: Design a satellite model that is reproducible and specifically used in the ESAL. 

OBJ-02: The satellites shall only use commodity hardware and have simplified designs incorporating these. (Note: The commodity hardware would include single-board computers, 3d printed/laser cut parts, free software such as COSMOS, etc.)  

OBJ-03: The satellites must cost significantly less than the available ESATS but have similar if not better capabilities. (e.g. Comparable sensor suite, onboard computer, and one-axis attitude control)  

OBJ-04: The design should be made such that it can be easily modified in case the satellite may need design adjustments for different operational contexts.  

OBJ-05: Fully document the design, assembly, and operation of the models for “future-proofing” under an operation manual.  

A senior design project to design a model satellite can draw upon the industry experience of several Florida Tech professors, and its capabilities could be tailored for space vehicles courses currently using ESAL lab hardware. Cheaper models would allow more students to use ESAL at once with less risk of breaking specialized, expensive hardware. Other projects involving space vehicles could immediately make use of cheaper, in-house models that faculty and some students will have had experience with.  


3. DELIVERABLES  

 - Hardware and Software Products:  

 - A compilation of the plans, schematics, and other design-related files. 

 - Cubesat-like models assembled by the ESAL team. 

 - Seamless integration with existing ground control software.  

 - Full documentation on the subsystems of the satellite model with operational instructions for differing functions.  

 - System where components in the satellites can be easily removed/replaced for different purposes. (e.g. a customizable build)  

 - Backup or interchangeable boards and components include in satellite “kit”.
